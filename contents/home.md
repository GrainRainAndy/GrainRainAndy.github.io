#### Research Interests

I’ve had some practical exposure to **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**. 
I’m also fascinated by **Embodied Intelligence** and **the Interpretability of Large Models**, which I haven't learned a lot yet but hope to explore further in the future (if given the chance:).
